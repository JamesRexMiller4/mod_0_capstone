              <p>Hi! My name is James, and welcome to my website. I am currently in the process of learning to become
                a <span class="bold">Front End Web Developer</span> at Turing's School of Software and Design in Denver, CO. I am 28 years
                old and have been living here in Colorado for almost 3 years.</p>
              <p> Originally, I was born in Chicago, but have lived
                in many states: Indiana, Illinois, California, Arizona, Kentucky, and now Colorado. I plan to one day go back to
                every state I have ever called home and plant a tree.</p>

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>I have been interested in programming and web development for some time. While attending the University of Arizona
              I was teaching myself to code with CodeCombat. My senior year I took a class that was part Computer Science and part
              Psychology and Philosophy. For the most part my web development skills were put on the back burner as I entered the workforce,
              gaining professional experience in logistics, financial services, hospitality, and electronics.<br><br>
              Every now and then I would think of a business idea and wish I had the technical prowess to design an app and build that idea.
              At long last I am taking the leap, and going full steam ahead into this next chapter of my life in becoming a Front End Developer
              and beyond.</p>

          <div class="hobbies">
          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>I am quite the connoisseur of comedy. While I was growing up in Chicago, I attended
            a summer camp at Second City, and I was hooked. I learned improv, sketch writing, and got to improvise scenes
            in front of audiences with my troupe. Sketch comedy, standup comedy, and comedic movies I love it all.</p> <br><br>

            <p>Additionally, I have been
            a fan of cartoons and animation. I have been thinking of leveraging some of the skills I plan to learn into
            making a game about a penguin that breaks free of the Brooklyn Zoo and has to try and survive in the jungle
            that is New York City. It will be called Sanguine Penguin, and be loosely based off the story of the Count of
            Monte Cristo, a tale of <span class="revenge">revenge</span> and adventure, and also my favorite book.<p>

          <h3>Favorite Comedies</h3>
          <ul>
            <span class="frank">
            <li><h4>Young Frankenstein</h4>
            <p>Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein starring Gene Wilder, is a parody
              black and white comedy/horror film of the classic tale Frankenstein. Gene Wilder plays
              Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, grandson of the infamous mad scientist Victor Frankenstein. After being informed of a certain relative's
              sudden passing, he is bequeathed a castle and an itch to follow in the Frankenstein footsteps.</p></li>
              <div class="youngf">
              </div>
            <li><h4>Bubba Ho Tep</h4>
              <p>Another comedy horror, this film takes place in a retirement home, where our
              protagonist, Elvis Presley, or at least someone who believes he is Elvis, is living
              out the last of his days. Trouble rises when an excavated Egyptian
              pharoah is awoken from his slumber, and begins feeding on the souls
              of the retirement community. Elvis and his comrade, John F. Kennedy, team up to kick
              some mummy ass.</p></li>
              <div class="bubba">
              </div>
            <li><h4>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h4>
              <p>The comedy troupe's tour de force, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the greatest comedies of all time. The film parodies
              the classic King Arthur tale. Accompanied by the Knights of the Round table, they embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail, encountering
              an apocalyptic murdering rabbit, 3 headed giants, a Trojan Rabbit, and the ultimate question: <br><br>
